### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

  ------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
  
__Graduate Student Researcher__

*2014 - Present*

Graduate research in plant community ecology, soil ecology, and restoration of grassland ecosystems. Current projects include assessment of temporally and spatially scale-dependent patterns of plant
biodiversity in California grasslands. Emphasis on statistical methodology and data analysis techniques.

__Data Analyst__ 

*2015*

Data analyst for the Ecological Society of America's Centennial Survey,
an effort to gauge the important discoveries and pressing concerns in
the last 100 years of ecological science. Evaluated survey responses,
assisted in production of presentation materials, and worked with a team
of researchers to produce multiple white papers.

__Lead Research Technician__ 

*2013 - 2014*

Lead technician for a multi-year NSF funded research project exploring
the impacts of *Typha* and *Phragmites* invasions on community
diversity, hydrology, and biogeochemical cycling. Responsible for sample
processing, data analysis, and coordination of field researchers.

__Undergraduate Researcher__

*2012-2013*
  
Undergraduate research on growth patterns of clonal plants, in addition
to support with field sampling, laboratory processing, production of
figures and statistical analyses, and assistance with ongiong graduate
student research.

__Research Technician__

*2012*

Research technician at the Archbold Biological Station studying endemic
plant demography and fire dynamics in the Florida scrub. Gained
experience in field research techniques, data management, and production
of visual materials.
