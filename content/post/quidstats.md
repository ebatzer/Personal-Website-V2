With [Andrew Axtell](https://github.com/BTA02?tab=stars) and 
[David Brownman](https://davidbrownman.com/), 
I've put together some analyses of data 
provided by the International Quidditch Associationto explore differences in 
team performance, assess different gameplay strategies, and predict outcomes of 
regional and national tournaments. 

For those familiar with the game of Quidditch found in the *Harry Potter* series, 
"Muggle Quidditch" is an interpretation of the same game played on many college
campuses worldwide. While it's participants aren't able to fly on magic brooms,
collegiate players have attempted to retain as much resemblance to the fictional
game as possible:

* There are 4 positions on the field (Keepers, Chasers, Beaters, and Seekers), 
each responsible for managing one of three balls (Quaffle, Bludger, and Snitch).

* Goals are scored by throwing the Quaffle into one of three upright hoops.

* When hit with a bludger a player is "knocked off" their broom and must recover.

* A successful catch of the Snitch by a Seeker ends the game and provides his or 
her team with a large boost in points.

This attempt at a faithful recreation of the fictional game of quidditch produces
an event that is not just whimsical, but also features a number of 
quirks that make it distinct from many standard games. Namely, by virtue of the 
snitch catch:

* Matches must end with a swing in the point total for one team.

* The total time to complete a match varies widely. 

When combined with the chaos of two balls being thrown around the pitch 
continuously (the Quaffle and Bludgers), Muggle Quidditch lends itself to
some fascinating questions on how the game operates and whether established
approaches to sports statistics remain informative.
